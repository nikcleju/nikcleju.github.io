## Bio
Dr. Nicolae CLEJU [PhD.'12, MSc.'09, BSc.'07] obtained his Ph.D. *summa cum laude* in 2012 from the Technical University "Gheorghe Asachi" of Iaşi, and has since joined the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, where he now holds a position of associate professor. Dr. Cleju teaches and has taught multiple classes in signal processing, information theory, C programming and related disciplines. 


Between 2014-2022 dr. Cleju has worked with Continental Automotive Romania, developing signal processing solutions for the automotive industry and, more recently, working on AI solutions for smart traffic infrastructure.
